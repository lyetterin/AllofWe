<h2>Inspiration for <i>All of We</i>
<lb></lb>
<h3>It Started in a Class</h3>
<p>In the Spring of 2023, the founder of <i>All of We</i> <a href= "https://lyetterin.github.io/all-about-me/">Lyette Erin</a> took the class <i>Advance Topics in Digital Humanities: ENGL877</i>. <mark>The students in this class, will work together to build from scratch a series of One More Voice satellite projects that support its mission. Your overarching goal will be to introduce contemporary users, especially those of your generation, to this project and to get them to engage meaningfully with its materials. To build the satellite projects, you will work together to create a series of interrelated and interlinked websites that transform the materials of One More Voice in multiple, creative ways. You thus will think outside the DH box as much as your individual and collective imaginations take you.</mark><p>

	<h3>Define <i>"ALL OF WE"</i></h3>
	<p>The sentiment of "all of we" is an umbrella term for the many phrases across the Caribbean with the sentiments of "we are one family". The aim of this project is to delve deeper into this sentiment to answer the question: Who <strong>exactly</strong> are we referring to when we say <i>"all of we"</i>? Through the attempt to answer this question, more questions arose, such as, is there such as thing as a unified <i>"Caribbean identity"</i>? And if so, how do we define the <i>"Caribbean identity"</i>? How do we decide who gets to identify as a part of the Caribbean family? Is it a question of where one is born? Or it is more about your values, traditions, or customs?</p>
	<p>To answer these questions, it was best to start from the beginning of the Caribbean roots. In order to explore the things that unite us, we must first understand what seperated us in the first place.</p>

<h3>Introduction to <i>ALL OF WE</i></h3>
	<p>This project was inspired by the question: Is it possible to build an accessible digital space that thoroughly explores the Caribbean identity? Here, the word accessible refers to a minimal computing approach which would allow the aging digitally distrustful Caribbean community to navigate on their own confidently and independently.</p>
	<p>The experience of slavery is the bedrock on which Caribbean society has been founded. The texts and images collected here tell the story of British colonialism, and of the enslaved West-Africans whose lives, labor, and land shaped the culture and development of the Caribbean region.</p>
	<p>The materials in the archive are primarily sourced from <a href= "onemorevoice.org"><i>One More Voice</i></a>, a digital archive that “focuses recovering non-European contributions from nineteenth-century British imperial and colonial archives”. For this purpose of this project, the materials have been selected to highlight the connection between Yoruba traditions and the creation of the Caribbean identity through the exploration of the colonization of faith and womanhood in enslavement.</p>
