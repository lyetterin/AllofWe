<h2>Inspiration for <i>All of We</i>
	<br/>
<h3>It Started in a Class</h3>
<p>In the Spring of 2023 during the first year of her master's program at <a href="https://www.unl.edu/english/ma">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>, the creater of <i>All of We</i>, <a href= "https://lyetterin.github.io/all-about-me/">Lyette Erin</a>, took the class <i>Advance Topics in Digital Humanities: ENGL877</i>. In this class, students collaborated to develop a set of <a href= "https://onemorevoice.org/"><i>One More Voice</i></a> satellite projects that aligned with its mission. The primary objective was to familiarize contemporary users, particularly from the younger generation, with the initiative and encourage their active involvement with its resources. Together, students constructed a collection of interconnected websites that creatively reimagined the materials found within <i>One More Voice</i>. As students embarked on this endeavor, they were encouraged to think beyond the traditional boundaries of digital humanities, which allowed the students' individual and collective imaginations to explore new possibilities.<p>

	<h3>Define <i>"ALL OF WE"</i></h3>
	<p>The concept of "all of we" encompasses various expressions throughout the Caribbean that convey the idea of a unified family. The purpose of this project is to delve deeper into this sentiment and address the precise meaning behind the phrase "all of we." As we attempt to unravel this question, it gives rise to further inquiries. For instance, is there truly a cohesive "Caribbean identity"? If so, how do we define it? Who is included in the Caribbean family, and what criteria determine their inclusion? Does it hinge on birthplace or extend to encompass values, traditions, and customs? To tackle these questions, it is essential to trace back to the origins of the Caribbean, exploring both the factors that bring us together and the factors that have historically set us apart. By understanding the forces of separation, we can then explore the shared aspects that unite us.</p>

<h3>Introduction to <i>ALL OF WE</i></h3>
	<p>This project was inspired by the question: Is it possible to build an accessible digital space that thoroughly explores the Caribbean identity? Here, the word accessible refers to a minimal computing approach which would allow the aging digitally distrustful Caribbean community to navigate on their own confidently and independently. The experience of slavery is the bedrock on which Caribbean society has been founded. The texts and images collected here tell the story of British colonialism, and of the enslaved West-Africans whose lives, labor, and land shaped the culture and development of the Caribbean region. The materials in the archive are primarily sourced from <i>One More Voice</i>, a digital archive that “focuses recovering non-European contributions from nineteenth-century British imperial and colonial archives”. For this purpose of this project, the materials have been selected to highlight the connection between Yoruba traditions and the creation of the Caribbean identity through the exploration of cultural identity, the colonization of faith, and womanhood in enslavement.</p>
