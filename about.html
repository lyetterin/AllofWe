<h2>Inspiration for <i>All of We</i>
<lb></lb>
<h3>It Started in a Class</h3>
<p>In the Spring of 2023, the founder of <i>All of We</i> <a href= "https://lyetterin.github.io/all-about-me/">Lyette Erin</a> took the class <i>Advance Topics in Digital Humanities: ENGL877</i>. <mark>The students in this class, will work together to build from scratch a series of One More Voice satellite projects that support its mission. Your overarching goal will be to introduce contemporary users, especially those of your generation, to this project and to get them to engage meaningfully with its materials. To build the satellite projects, you will work together to create a series of interrelated and interlinked websites that transform the materials of One More Voice in multiple, creative ways. You thus will think outside the DH box as much as your individual and collective imaginations take you.</mark><p>
