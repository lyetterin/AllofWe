	<h3>Stories of Yoruba Women</h3>
	<p class="two">Yoruba women's roles as matriarchs, community leaders, and keepers of cultural knowledge became intertwined with the experiences of Caribbean women. Both Yoruba and Caribbean women have often held significant social and economic responsibilities within their communities, managing households, engaging in trade and entrepreneurship, and participating in community organizing efforts. This shared history of resistance, resilience, and the preservation of cultural heritage has fostered a deep connection between Yoruba women and Caribbean women, forming a powerful bond that transcends geographic boundaries.</p>
