	<h5>One More Voice Materials</h5>
		<p class="two">As <i>All of We</i> is a satelite project from <i>One More Voice</i>, we have sourced material from there that discuss the transatlantic slave trade and the Yoruba people, specifically women. The connection between Yoruba women, slavery, and the creation of Caribbean identity is multifaceted and significant. During the transatlantic slave trade, Yoruba women were among the many African individuals forcibly transported to the Caribbean as enslaved laborers. Their experiences and contributions played a pivotal role in shaping the Caribbean identity.</p>

	<h3>Stories of Yoruba Women</h3>
	<p class="two">Yoruba women's roles as matriarchs, community leaders, and keepers of cultural knowledge became intertwined with the experiences of Caribbean women. Both Yoruba and Caribbean women have often held significant social and economic responsibilities within their communities, managing households, engaging in trade and entrepreneurship, and participating in community organizing efforts. This shared history of resistance, resilience, and the preservation of cultural heritage has fostered a deep connection between Yoruba women and Caribbean women, forming a powerful bond that transcends geographic boundaries.</p>

	<h3>Stories of Caribbean Slavery</h3>
	<p class="two">In the Caribbean, Africans from different regions were mixed together, often intentionally, to disrupt linguistic and ethnic ties and prevent organized resistance. This led to the formation of new social identities among enslaved individuals. The transatlantic slave trade profoundly shaped the Caribbean identity by bringing together diverse African cultures, influencing language, religion, and cultural practices, and fostering a collective consciousness of resilience and resistance. The legacy of the slave trade continues to inform and shape Caribbean identity today, serving as a reminder of the strength, diversity, and resilience of the Caribbean people.</p>

	<h3> Academic Scholarship </h3>
		<p class="two">The above materials from <i>One More Voice</i> discuss several topics that are explored in academic conversations. We've highlighted three themes&#8212;Cultural Identity, Colonisation of Faith, and Womanhood and Slavery&#8212;and provided resources to explore these topics in the larger academic conversation.</p>
		
	<h4>Cultural Identity</h4>
	<p>The articles <a href= “https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/525567.pdf”>"The Role of Africa in the Construction of Identities in the Caribbean'' </a>by Mervyn C. Alleyne, <a href= “https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242259877_After_Empire_National_Identity_and_Post-Colonial_Families_of_Nations”>"After Empire: National Identity and Post-Colonial Families of Nations''</a> by Alison Brysk et al., and <a href= “https://nigeriaworld.com/articles/2011/nov/091.html”>"The Relevance of African Traditional Religion in the Modern World"</a> by Akogun Tola Adeniyi share a common thread in their exploration of the influence of African culture and heritage on identity formation in different contexts. While each article focuses on distinct aspects&#812;Alleyne delving into the Caribbean, Brysk et al. examining post-colonial nations, and Adeniyi discussing African traditional religion&#8212;they collectively emphasize the significance of African contributions in shaping identities and worldviews beyond the African continent. By highlighting the impact of African cultural practices, histories, and spiritual beliefs, these articles underline the enduring connections between Africa and its diaspora, illustrating the lasting influence of African heritage on the construction of identities in diverse societies.</p>
	
	<h4>Colonization of Faith</h4>
	<p>The articles <a href= “https://iiste.org/Journals/index.php/JPCR/article/view/28207”>"The Impact of the Yorùbá Traditional Belief in Reincarnation among Yorùbá Christians in Akurẹ"</a> by Oladotun B. Osanyinbi and Adebisi G. M. Adedeji, <a href= “https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/0966735008091401”>"A Socio-Cultural Analysis of Yoruba Women and the Re-imagining of Christianity"</a> by Oyeronke Olajubu, and <a href= “https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1177/026537880602300407”>"The Creation of Afro-Caribbean Religions and their Incorporation of Christian Elements: A Critique against Syncretism"</a> by Bettina E. Schmidt share a common focus on the intersection between Yorùbá traditional beliefs and Christianity within the Yorùbá community. While approaching the topic from different angles, these articles collectively shed light on the complex dynamics of religious syncretism, adaptation, and re-imagining among Yorùbá Christians. They explore how Yorùbá traditional beliefs and practices, including reincarnation and the roles of Yorùbá women, interact and intertwine with Christian theology and rituals. Additionally, Schmidt's article offers a critical examination of the incorporation of Christian elements into Afro-Caribbean religions, raising questions about the concept of syncretism. Together, these articles contribute to a nuanced understanding of the religious landscape among Yorùbá Christians and the complexities of blending traditional beliefs with Christianity in Yorùbá and Afro-Caribbean contexts.</p>
		
	<h4>Womanhood and Slavery</h4>
	<p class="three">The articles <a href=“https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02619288.1982.9974512”>"Defiance or Submission? The Role of the Slave Woman in Slave Resistance in the British Caribbean"</a> by Barbara Bush, <a href= “https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2010.01613.x”>"Gender, Sexuality and the Formation of Racial Identities in the Eighteenth-Century Anglo-Caribbean World"</a> by Brooke N. Newman, and <a href= “https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0094582X8501200104”>"Women and Slavery in the Caribbean: A Feminist Perspective"</a> by Rhoda E. Reddock share a common focus on the experiences and agency of enslaved women in the Caribbean. These articles highlight the multifaceted roles of slave women in resistance, the formation of racial identities, and the broader dynamics of slavery. They challenge traditional narratives that often overlook or undermine the agency and contributions of enslaved women. By exploring the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality, these articles provide a nuanced understanding of the experiences of enslaved women in the Caribbean, highlighting their resilience, acts of resistance, and contributions to shaping the social and cultural fabric of the region. Collectively, they contribute to a feminist perspective that seeks to give voice to and acknowledge the important role of women within the context of slavery in the Caribbean.</p>
