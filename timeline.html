      <h4>Explore the questions raised in <i>What's in a Name?</i> by Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton</h4>
      <p>At the end of, "What's in a Name?" by Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton, questions such as, "should a lab be created?", "who will have access to the lab, and how is this communicated?", "how is work by members of the lab credited?", and "how are resources allocated?" were raised in regard to Digital Humanities labs. The articles explore the Digital Humanities centres of Indiana University, UCLA, University of Nother Carolina, Yale University, University of Pennsylvania, and other predominantly white institutions. The article explores how these institutions get funded, that language used by these institutions, and why these institutions are important, and while I'm intrigued and interested in the answers Arnold and Tilton offer to these questions, I'm more interested in how the questions posed by Arnold and Tilton apply to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).</p>
      <p>On the question of, "should a lab be created?", in the case of HBCUs, the answer is a resounding: yes. However, the follow up questions to that would be, how can the culture of HBCU’s be translated into digital learning spaces, and if yes, what should that look like? HBCU Digital Learning Infrastructure Initiative is an organization that is working towards establishing digital learning centres within HBCUs. However, this initiative isn't geared specifically towards digital humanities, but geared towards bringing technological support to classrooms at HBCUs. Therefore, it makes me wonder, if HBCUs are still struggling to bring technology into the classrooms, then how are they able to even begin to establish digital humanities labs? Therefore, despite deserving labs, if they're still struggling to fund technology in the classrooms, then how do they compete against their counterparts for funding of a digital humanities lab?</p>
      <p>This brings us to the question of, "how are resources allocated?", whilst this might be a reasonable question for PWIs with funding for digital humanities labs—in terms of 'how are the funds spent on which projects?'—however, the question for HBCUs is: 'how do they gain access to funding?'. The National Endowment for the Humanities has a grant, "Humanities Initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities", that's up to $150,000. According to the National Endowment for the Humanities, this grant has been awarded for 13 years, and receives on average of 14 applications per year, and awards on average 2 applicants per year. While this isn't the only funding available to HBCUs for digital humanities, it's the only government fund. There are currently 101 HBCUs. That means there are potentially 101 institutions vying for $150,000. Institutions that are already behind the technology initiative, and when they overcome that obstacle, they must fight each other for $150,000. Yes, they could apply for other grants available for digital humanitities, however, they would be fighting against institutions, such as the ones Arnold and Tilton used as examples. So, when Arnold and Tilton pose the question: "how are resources allocated?", the question shouldn't just be posed to the institutions but to the ones funding the resources. When that question is assigned properly then the questions, such as why is the Charles Chesnutt Archive at a PWI and not at an HBCU?</p>

      <h3>February 10, 2023</h3>
      <h4>Reflect on <i>Reprogramming the Invisible Discipline: An Emancipatory Approach to Digital Technology through Higher Education</i> by Erin Rose Glass</h4>
      <p>In her essay, "Reprogramming the Invisible Discipline: An Emancipatory Approach to Digital Technology through Higher Education" Erin Rose Glass offers, "an analysis of digital technologies that instead focuses on the broader social and political realities that they reinforce, support, or create". I will admit that I had never thought deeply about the technology that I've used, nor the technologies that have been made available to me throughout my academic career. Glass argues that the current academic system is "teaching students to passively accept black-boxed, company-controlled technologies for research and writing". Glass's argument has forced me to reflect on my own unquestioned usage of technology in my academic career. My high school was fitted with IBM computers, my undergrad was on the Apple grid and connected everyone with Google office tools, and now UNL is connected through Microsoft office. Glass is correct, I have blindly and passively accepted whatever technological tools were given to me.</p>
      <p>Glass asserts that most believe that "the way higher education has long encouraged (or even taught, if you will) its members to passively accept digital technology within research and learning environments as predominantly natural, neutral, and inevitable". Oftentimes people believe that technology is impartial, that is doesn't hold biases, however, people often forget that technology isn't an independent third party that exists in a vacuum. Technology is created and chosen by people. People are biased; therefore, it isn't unfathomable that people lean to those biases when they code technology and decide which form/program of technology is used. Glass writes that "in an academic culture submerged in the corporate ethos of speed, a rejection of popular digital tools and the important time-saving, collaborative, and networking affordances they offer may feel equivalent to professional suicide". Therefore, we, we as in academics, don't stop to think about the tools we are using, which means we don't consider what biases are in place, and then we become complacent and a part of a larger problem, the problem of unchecked biases.</p>
      <p>So, what do we do about this problem? Glass suggests that "rather than teaching students to unquestioningly accept academic technologies, we might train them in the practices and values of community-governed software and encourage them to consider how they might continue to shape digital tools according to their needs and interests". When we stop and think about the tools that are given to us, then maybe we'll be able to check the biases that bar certain people and technologies from the light. Glass believes that "the cost of our complacency is not simply our individual privacy but is also the training of a generation to helplessly accept digital oppression as if there is no other choice". When Glass speaks of "digital oppression", I think of Storygraph, a digital book club much like its competitor, Goodreads. However, unlike Goodreads (owned and operated by Amazon), Storygraph was created by and ran by a black woman. Digital oppression just furthers the oppression of marginalized people.</p>

      <h4>Reflect on <i>Undisciplining Victorian Studies</i> by Ronjaunee Chatterjee, Alicia Mireles Christoff, and Amy R. Wong</h4>
      <p>I'm a first year English master student who is currently exploring potential thesis topics. In the process to figure out what I want to spend the next year writing, I've been exploring the different time periods. Despite everyone telling me, I should consider a topic within the 19th century, I've been very adamant about steering clear of it. I haven't been able to figure out exactly what disconnects me, a person predominantly trained in British Literature in a country that was colonized by the British, from the 19th century, however during this week's reading I've come to understand my aversion to the 19th century. In the essay, "Undiscipling Victorian Studies", Ronjaunee Chatterjee, Alicia Mireles Christoff, and Amy R. Wong write that, "the study of the 19th century in Britain&#8212;a period and geographical center that consolidated a modern idea of race&#8212;lack, in its contemporary scholarship, a rigorous account of race and racialization". Oftentimes I either felt attacked or erased&#8212;both of which are violent in their own ways&#8212;during my experiences studying the 19th century. Therefore, I was eager to learn how Chatterjee, Christoff, and Wong suggest how to overhaul Victorian Studies.</p>
      <p>Ronjaunee Chatterjee, Alicia Mireles Christoff, and Amy R. Wong argue in their essay, "Undisciplining Victorian Studies" that the field of Victorian Studies needs "a more robust historical and theoretical account of our objects of study that will more properly attend to the whiteness (as white supremacy) that structures [the] field's scholarly and social practices". I must admit when I initially read their argument despite agreeing, I was wary of the type of 'renovation' they were suggesting. It had been my experience that oftentimes when well-meaning white people seek to expand a framework to be more inclusive and diverse, simply result in adding works by marginalized communities within a white supremacist framework.</p>
      <p>However, Chatterjee, Christoff and Wong were adamant that they weren't "advocating for an accumulative project that would leave the boundaries of VS untouched and intact" but rather change the thinking framework of "scholarly fields and of field-formation itself", "radically rethink and even unmake VS itself", and "resist assimilationist thinking". Instead, Chatterjee, Christoff and Wong suggest that the Victorian Studies engage in "scholarship across fields and disciplines for a richer cross-fertilization of ideas...a refashioning of academic structures to better serve the purposes of equity and justice". Though this sounds like a viable idea, as a Black woman in academia it has been my experience that most educational frameworks are steeped in Anti-blackness. Therefore, the problem isn't within the framework of Victorian Studies but rather the educational framework, which would make sense the foundation of education was never meant to withstand the inclusion of minority communities.</p>

      <h3>February 24, 2023</h3>
      <h4>Write a "Manifesto" to Guide the Development of Course Project</h4>
      <p>Throughout the semester, I’ve been considering tension between minority identities and power structures and how the digital space could aggravate that tension. There are several essays that have helped me think through and complicate my thoughts. The essays “What’s in a Name?" by Arnold, Taylor, and Lauren Tilton, “Anglophone World Literatures: Introduction” by Neumann, Birgit, and Gabriele Rippl, “Undisciplining Victorian Studies” by Chatterjee, Ronjaunee, Alicia Mireles Christoff, and Amy R. Wong, and “Intersectionality and Infrastructure: Toward a Critical Digital Humanities” by Christina Boyles all explore different aspects of identity and power structures. Despite their different focuses, these essays share several common themes.</p>
      <p>One such theme is the idea that identity is complex and multifaceted. “What’s in a Name?” highlights the idea that names can carry a lot of cultural and personal significance, and that they are not always straightforward or easy to understand. Similarly, “Anglophone World Literatures” explores the complexities of identity in literature, noting that authors often draw on multiple cultures and experiences to create their work. “Intersectionality and Infrastructure” takes this a step further, arguing that we must recognize the multiple identities that individuals hold and the ways in which they intersect and influence each other. These essays all demonstrate that identity is not a simple or fixed concept, but rather a complex and constantly evolving one. Therefore, I’m forced to wonder, since identities are complex and constantly changing, then how do we develop a digital space that accommodates and evolves alongside identities?</p>
      <p>Another common theme is the idea that power structures play a significant role in shaping identity and experience. “What’s in a Name?” notes that names can be used to exert power over individuals or to reinforce dominant cultural norms. “Undisciplining Victorian Studies” explores the power structures inherent in academic disciplines, arguing that we must critically examine and challenge these structures in order to create more inclusive and diverse fields of study. Similarly, “Intersectionality and Infrastructure” argues that power structures are embedded in the technology we use and the digital spaces we inhabit, and that we must actively work to dismantle these structures in order to create more equitable and just systems. These essays sparked the question, if it were possible to create a digital space that accommodates and evolves alongside identities, how do we then ensure that the language used within this digital space isn't coded white supremacist language? Hence, I was intrigued by the essay, "Anglophone World Literatures", which argues that we must more beyond the narrow canon of "great" literature and engage with a broader range or voices and experiences. If we were to take this argument and apply it to language at large, would this expand our understandings and the language used in digital spaces.</p>

      <h4>Questions on Building Digital Infrastructure that withstands Evolving Identities and the Anti-Digital Caribbean</h4>
      <p>Throughout the semester, I’ve been considering tension between minority identities and power structures and how the digital space could aggravate that tension. This week's reading about minimal computing has thrown another wrench in my thinking. I've been trying to figure out where I fit in the field of Digital Humanities. As a black woman from a country that is primarily analog, how do I exist in a digital space without losing any aspect or compromising on my identities?</p>
      <p>The essays “What’s in a Name?" by Arnold, Taylor, and Lauren Tilton, “Anglophone World Literatures: Introduction” by Neumann, Birgit, and Gabriele Rippl, “Undisciplining Victorian Studies” by Chatterjee, Ronjaunee, Alicia Mireles Christoff, and Amy R. Wong, “Intersectionality and Infrastructure: Toward a Critical Digital Humanities” by Christina Boyles, "Africa's Digitalization: From the Ecological Dilemma to the Decolonization of the Imaginary'' by Cédric Letermeand, and "Introduction: The Questions of Minimal Computing” by Roopika Risam and Alex Gil explore different aspects of identity and power structures and have helped me to explore my position with Digital Humanities.</p>
      <p>One such theme is the idea that identity is complex and multifaceted. “What’s in a Name?” highlights the idea that names can carry a lot of cultural and personal significance, and that they are not always straightforward or easy to understand. Similarly, “Anglophone World Literatures” explores the complexities of identity in literature, noting that authors often draw on multiple cultures and experiences to create their work. “Intersectionality and Infrastructure” takes this a step further, arguing that we must recognize the multiple identities that individuals hold and the ways in which they intersect and influence each other. These essays all demonstrate that identity is not a simple or fixed concept, but rather a complex and constantly evolving one. Therefore, I’m forced to wonder, since identities are complex and constantly changing, then how do we develop a digital space that accommodates and evolves alongside identities? The essay "Introduction: The Questions of Minimal Computing” by Roopika Risam and Alex Gil discusses the concept of minimal computing, which involves using the least amount of resources possible to create and access digital content. This has complicated my thinking because if it were possible to develop an evolving digital space, how would it be possible to develop that space in a minimal computing fashion?</p>
      <p>As someone from a Caribbean country that is behind in the digital age, I'm extremely interested in the process of closing the gap. In the essay "Africa's Digitalization: From the Ecological Dilemma to the Decolonization of the Imaginary'', Cédric Leterme argues that digitalization can be a tool for decolonization by promoting African narratives and challenging Western stereotypes. Leterme suggests that African content creators need to have greater control over the production and distribution of digital content, and for digital literacy and education to be promoted among African populations. This solution sounds like it would be easy to apply within the Caribbean community, however, specifically in my country, there's a distrust of anything digital. Therefore, I wonder if taking a minimal computing approach to introducing and implementing digital spaces to/within the Caribbean would be more effective?</p>
      <p>I believe the most accurate and concise question that encompasses all of my thinking is: <i>How do we build an accessible evolving digital space that properly upholds the Caribbean identity?</i></p>
      <p>Another common theme is the idea that power structures play a significant role in shaping identity and experience. “What’s in a Name?” notes that names can be used to exert power over individuals or to reinforce dominant cultural norms. “Undisciplining Victorian Studies” explores the power structures inherent in academic disciplines, arguing that we must critically examine and challenge these structures in order to create more inclusive and diverse fields of study. Similarly, “Intersectionality and Infrastructure” argues that power structures are embedded in the technology we use and the digital spaces we inhabit, and that we must actively work to dismantle these structures in order to create more equitable and just systems.

      <p><b><i>Mission Statement:</i></b></p>
      <p>A digital infrastructure that explores the complex Caribbean identity that invites the anti-digital Caribbean community.</p>
      <p><b><i>Introduction:</i></b></p>
      <p>This project was inspired by the question: Is it possible to build an accessible digital space that thoroughly explores the Caribbean identity? Here, the word accessible refers to a minimal computing approach which would allow the aging digitally distrustful Caribbean community to confidently and independently navigate on their own.</p>
      <p>The experience of slavery is the bedrock on which Caribbean society has been founded. The texts and images collected here tell the story of British colonialism, and of the enslaved West-Africans whose lives, labor, and land shaped the culture and development of the Caribbean region.</p>
      <p>The materials in the archive are primarily sourced from One More Voice, a digital archive that “focuses recovering non-European contributions from nineteenth-century British imperial and colonial archives”. For this purpose of this project, the materials have been selected to highlight the connection between Yoruba traditions and the creation of the Caribbean identity through the exploration of the colonization of faith and womanhood in enslavement.</p>
