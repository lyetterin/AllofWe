      <h4>Prompt: Explore the questions raised in <i>What's in a Name?</i> by Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton</h4>
      <p>At the end of, "What's in a Name?" by Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton, questions such as, "should a lab be created?", "who will have access to the lab, and how is this communicated?", "how is work by members of the lab credited?", and "how are resources allocated?" were raised in regard to Digital Humanities labs. The articles explore the Digital Humanities centres of Indiana University, UCLA, University of Nother Carolina, Yale University, University of Pennsylvania, and other predominantly white institutions. The article explores how these institutions get funded, that language used by these institutions, and why these institutions are important, and while I'm intrigued and interested in the answers Arnold and Tilton offer to these questions, I'm more interested in how the questions posed by Arnold and Tilton apply to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).</p>
      <p>On the question of, "should a lab be created?", in the case of HBCUs, the answer is a resounding: yes. However, the follow up questions to that would be, how can the culture of HBCU’s be translated into digital learning spaces, and if yes, what should that look like? HBCU Digital Learning Infrastructure Initiative is an organization that is working towards establishing digital learning centres within HBCUs. However, this initiative isn't geared specifically towards digital humanities, but geared towards bringing technological support to classrooms at HBCUs. Therefore, it makes me wonder, if HBCUs are still struggling to bring technology into the classrooms, then how are they able to even begin to establish digital humanities labs? Therefore, despite deserving labs, if they're still struggling to fund technology in the classrooms, then how do they compete against their counterparts for funding of a digital humanities lab?</p>
      <p>his brings us to the question of, "how are resources allocated?", whilst this might be a reasonable question for PWIs with funding for digital humanities labs—in terms of 'how are the funds spent on which projects?'—however, the question for HBCUs is: 'how do they gain access to funding?'. The National Endowment for the Humanities has a grant, "Humanities Initiatives at Historically Black Colleges and Universities", that's up to $150,000. According to the National Endowment for the Humanities, this grant has been awarded for 13 years, and receives on average of 14 applications per year, and awards on average 2 applicants per year. While this isn't the only funding available to HBCUs for digital humanities, it's the only government fund. There are currently 101 HBCUs. That means there are potentially 101 institutions vying for $150,000. Institutions that are already behind the technology initiative, and when they overcome that obstacle, they must fight each other for $150,000. Yes, they could apply for other grants available for digital humanitities, however, they would be fighting against institutions, such as the ones Arnold and Tilton used as examples. So, when Arnold and Tilton pose the question: "how are resources allocated?", the question shouldn't just be posed to the institutions but to the ones funding the resources. When that question is assigned properly then the questions, such as why is the Charles Chesnutt Archive at a PWI and not at an HBCU?</p>
