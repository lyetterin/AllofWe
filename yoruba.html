<h2>Africans Have Made the Caribbean</h2>

<h3>How Were the Enslaved Africans Distributed Across the British Caribbean?</h3>
<p>The Atlantic slave trade, transatlantic slave trade, Euro-American slave trade or the Triangular Trade Route (Europe-Africa-Caribbean) involved the transportation by slave traders of various enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Boats collected forcibly enslaved Africans on the West Coast of Africa (1st port) and transported them to the Americas (2nd port, or Middle Passage) and then returned finished goods (rum, sugar, coffee, tobacco) to Europe (3rd port) forming a triangular route. A total of 1.8 million enslaved Africans died en route to the Americas, (Britannica).  Others committed suicide even before the journey started. About two-thirds of all enslaved Africans brought to the Caribbean were distributed and sold to the sugar plantations. Jamaica and Barbados were the two islands in the British Caribbean that received the most enslaved people. Between 1606 and 1842, nearly one million enslaved people passed through Jamaica and nearly half a million were sent to Barbados, according to <i>Britannica</i>.</p>
	
<h3>origin of the Caribbean Identity</h3>
	<p>This will be a paragraph</p>
		
<h3>Why were Africans enslaved and brought to the Caribbean?</h3>
<p>Caribbean and African ties run deep. They are based on a shared history, culture, and sense of a common identity forged by the slave trade which forcibly relocated more than 10 million Africans to the New World, in the process, creating large centres of African Diaspora in the Caribbean and elsewhere. The common historical experiences of slavery and colonialism inspired formation of the Pan-African Movement in the first half of the 1900â€™s led by the African Diaspora outside of Africa.</p>

<h3>Where did Enslaved Africans Come From?</h3>
<p>Enslaved Africans brought to the West Indies mostly originated from West Africa: Nigeria, Congo, Ghana, Mali, Senegal, Benin etc.. The British brought many different tribes of Africans to the Caribbean including Yoruba, Igbo,  Mandinka, Kongo, Ibibio. About two-thirds of all enslaved Africans brought to the Caribbean were distributed and sold to the sugar plantations. Jamaica and Barbados were the two islands in the British Caribbean that received the most enslaved people. Between 1606 and 1842, nearly one million enslaved people passed through Jamaica and nearly half a million were sent to Barbados, according to Britannica.</p>
